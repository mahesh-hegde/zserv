## zserv

Simple HTTP server that serves files from .zip files

Useful to save locally mirrored websites (eg: using `wget`) as zip and then serve pages directly from that file.

Can specify custom port, host and website root relative to ZIP file. Host defaults to localhost (`127.0.0.1`) and will not be accessible from other devices on the network.
